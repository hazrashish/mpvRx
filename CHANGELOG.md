## 1.3.9

> # 🚀 **CURL IS NOW SUPPORTED!** 
> ### ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL** — This is brand new and may or may not work properly on your device. ⚠️
> Lua and JavaScript scripts can now make HTTP requests through the new native libcurl bridge via JNI.
> Use it, break it, and report issues so we can make it stable!, see `MPVRX_CUSTOM_COMMANDS.d` for tutorial on how to use in Lua and JS.
>
> **What this means:** You can now write scripts that fetch data from the internet — APIs, subtitles, metadata, you name it — all through libcurl compiled directly into the app.

- AI support has been updated. Gemini is removed and OpenCode Zen AI is now available for AI rename, subtitle formatting, and subtitle translation.
- AI model lists now come from the provider APIs instead of a saved model list in the app. OpenRouter also marks free models using the pricing data returned by OpenRouter itself.
- Background playback is fixed so repeat keeps working after using the headphone button, and returning to the player no longer restarts the current stream from the beginning.
- Subtitle search has been updated for the latest Wyzie source changes.
- Added Hybrid Skip Markers. The player can now check IntroDB, TIDB, and AniSkip together and use whichever result is found first.
- Anime4K settings are now easier to use with a collapsible section in Decoder Preferences and also Added Optimization by Sunny Vishnu .
- Added a setting to show or hide Media Info from Android's share/open-with screen.
- Added documentation for custom Lua/JS player commands in `MPVRX_CUSTOM_COMMANDS.md`.

## 1.3.8

- **Integrated yt-dlp by [**SunnyVishnu3**](https://github.com/SunnyVishnu3)** — Added full yt-dlp integration for video watching audio/video from YouTube and other supported sites directly within the app (_Dont expect from me to add Download Functionality_). **Note: You need to download yt-dlp first (Settings > Advanced > yt-dlp Manager) before playing YouTube links — don't be clueless.**
- Fixed Issue of USer defined Colors Filters were not getting Saved and not getting applied through Mpv conf by [**SunnyVishnu3**](https://github.com/SunnyVishnu3)
- Fixed Gemini AI Error Generating / Translating Subs.
- Fixed Crashing issue of MpvRx , in a nutshell Ambient mode and Custom lua were not initialized in Sync causing to crash player sometimes
- That's all for Today Adiosss!!

## 1.3.7

- **Updated Wyzie subtitle API integration** — Synced with latest Wyzie API changes: added `ai` field for AI-translated subtitle detection, updated provider sources list (removed `subdl`, `podnapisi`, `ajatttools`; added `tvsubtitles`), and fixed TMDB endpoints to include API key authentication.
- **Material 3 Expressive Design** — Complete visual overhaul using Material 3 Expressive design system for a more modern, fluid, and engaging experience
- **Smoother Animations** — Replaced rigid linear transitions with spring-based physics animations throughout the app (navigation, controls, browser, dialogs)
- Added Voltage Battery Temperature And improved the style of Page 6 
- Added Optimized Ambient Mode with Eco Battery Saver Mode who want to take feel of Ambient without much Battery Impact
- Removed Dead Code and also Optimized some File Handling / Ui Rendering Operations
- **Settings export now stores app version**  exported XML files include the app version, so import dialogs show the correct version instead of "unknown".
- **HEVC 10bit thumbnails**  added a software-decoder fallback using Android's MediaCodec API. When the system can't decode a video frame (e.g. HEVC 10bit on devices without hardware support), the app now tries Google's software decoder before giving up. This means more thumbnails will show up on devices with limited codec support ( To be tested Propelry on unsupported device).
- **Fixed app icon on Android 16**  changed the adaptive icon background from transparent to opaque black so the icon doesn't disappear on launchers that don't handle transparency well.
- **User mpv.conf now has highest priority**  during player startup, your mpv.conf settings are re-applied after all app defaults so they always take precedence. but some of the Hardcoded things doesnt change like for example `sid, aid`.
- 

## 1.3.6

- **Six AI providers, one gorgeous settings page**  OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Together joined Groq and Gemini in a completely redesigned UI. Every provider gets its own API key, every single model is visible (free ones get a bold green badge), and the new searchable model picker sorts free models to the top. The offline model experience got a premium card-based overhaul too  tiers, speed/translation badges, device recommendations, DeepSeek-R1 support, reasoning toggles, and a benchmark button for downloaded models. One-tap download, delete, and switch between models without ever leaving the screen.

- **Subtitle translation**  SUPPORTS ASS Subs Translation tooooooooo..... , you can now configure your target languages once in settings. One language means one tap to translate. Two or more means a clean picker showing only the languages you chose. Translation progress appears right on the video screen (even with the sheet closed), partially translated subs survive restarts, and a red X lets you cancel mid-translation instantly. When using local models, the system automatically picks the best downloaded model for each language, keeps it warm between chunks, and never runs two local AI jobs at once.

- **Generate subtitles from video audio**  **_(EXPERIMENTAL)_** This is work in progress might not work Don't baby Cry that this shit aint working ,i ain't getting paid enough to implement this whole heartedly , so what it does is -> one tap generates subtitles using the audio you're already playing. Media3 extraction feeds Groq, Gemini, or offline Whisper, and the resulting SRT/VTT saves automatically.

- **Smarter AI across the board**  reasoning tags are automatically stripped from final results, token limits prevent stalls in heavy tasks, and every AI feature (rename, formatting, translation) comes with customizable prompts that fall back gracefully to built-in instructions.

- **Real-time subtitle toggle**  new on/off switch in AI settings to control real-time subtitle generation from audio. When off, the indicator and generate button are hidden from the player.

- **AI features respect the master switch**  turning off AI Integration now hides all AI indicators (translation, real-time subs) and buttons (generate, translate, format) from the player view. Renamed "AI Subtitle Search Formatting" to "AI Search" for clarity.


## 1.3.5

- **Removed Play Store and F-Droid build variants**  streamlined to a single `standard` flavor with full update support and all features enabled.
- **Revamped README**  comprehensive feature documentation organized by category, UPI QR code and Buy Me a Coffee links in the Support section.
- **SMB Network Thumbnail Generation**  fixed thumbnail generation for SMB shares through Codex AI (Beta).
- **Bulk AI Rename**  rename multiple files at once using Gemini or Groq with concurrency limiting and edge case handling.
- **AI Subtitle Translation**  translate subtitles using AI providers with custom prompts, progress indication, and user preference management.
- **AI Subtitle Translation Enhancements**  in-house developed translation pipeline with fully customizable prompts and per-user preference overrides.

## 1.3.4

- Capped generated thumbnails to safer preview sizes so large videos do not waste memory while browsing.
- Improved MKV/WebM thumbnail handling, including embedded artwork and smarter fallback frames.
- Cleaned old thumbnail cache paths when clearing thumbnail cache.
- Fixed the About and crash info screen showing `UNKNOWN` in the bundled mpv version.

- Added Window Offset to prevent Camera notch overlap issues


## 1.3.3

- Fixed Background Playback and Pip issues 
- Anime4K should feel much smoother now. The player now uses the clean six-preset Anime4K flow from the reference app and avoids piling old shader work on top of the new preset when you switch modes.
- Anime4K is still off by default, but when you turn it on the picker is simpler: Off, A, B, C, A+, B+, and C+.
- Moved the Fast / Balanced / High Anime4K choice into Decoder settings, with Balanced as the default.
- Removed frame interpolation because it added a lot of GPU load and did not add enough real value.
- Removed the old OneThird and Halfway thumbnail choices.
- Removed the unused old player screen path.
- Cleaned up the track sheets so audio, subtitle, chapter, decoder, and online subtitle lists no longer depend on the old generic sheet.
- Removed SubDL from subtitle search sources.
- Network streaming is now opt-in instead of being enabled on a fresh install.
- HDR and Ambient controls are no longer placed on the default player buttons, so heavy visual extras stay out of the way unless you add them yourself.
- Turning HDR on now starts with Linear HDR by default.
- The app now does less background media scanning and cache cleanup on startup, which should help large libraries open with less churn.
- Added new MpvLib File with Some Optimization and Removing Deprecated Andorid Versions
- Thumbnails are now Loaded Faster and more Precisly

## 1.3.2

### HDR hdr-toys Pipeline

- Replaced the old 3-mode HDR system (Off / SDR with HDR / Normal HDR) with a proper shader-based pipeline powered by [hdr-toys](https://github.com/natural-harmonia-gropius/hdr-toys).
- Four HDR modes are now available: **BT.2100 PQ** (HDR10), **BT.2100 HLG**, **BT.2020**, and **Linear HDR** (mpv-native, no shaders).
- 77 GLSL shaders are bundled in the app and copied to the mpv config directory on first use  no manual setup required.
- The HDR panel no longer shows an "Off" option. Off is the default and is toggled by the HDR button; the panel only presents the four active modes.
- Selecting a mode while GPU Next + Vulkan is unavailable shows a clear error pill and falls back to Off safely.
- Added `boostSdrToHdr` preference (used by the Linear HDR path).
- `HdrToysManager` cleanly removes all hdr-toys shaders when switching to Off or when the pipeline is not ready, so no stale shaders leak between sessions.

### Thermal & Battery Improvements

- Added `ThermalMonitor`  samples `PowerManager.getThermalHeadroom()` (Android 11+) every 10 seconds during playback.
- Ambient shader sample budget is automatically capped based on thermal headroom: 8 samples (severe), 12 (moderate), 18 (mild), uncapped (cool).
- Anime4K is proactively downgraded to C/Fast when thermal headroom drops below 40%, before frame drops even start.
- Ambient shader recompilation is now skipped when all parameters are identical to the last compiled version  reduces unnecessary GPU stutter on orientation changes and no-op callbacks.
- Removed redundant dual position polling: the event-driven `time-pos` observer and the polling loop were both updating the same StateFlow, causing double seek-bar recompositions on every MPV event.
- Background playback position poll interval halved from 250 ms to 500 ms when controls are not visible, cutting idle JNI wake-ups by 50%.

### Stats Page 6  Fixes

- **GPU estimate bar fixed**: was using cumulative drop + delay totals that drifted to 100% after long sessions and added a fixed FPS-proportional baseline (120fps with zero drops showed 70% GPU load). Now uses per-second delta counts relative to the current frame rate  0 drops = 0%, all frames dropped = 100%.
- **CPU label corrected**: relabelled from "CPU Usage" to "App CPU (this process)" to accurately reflect that `getElapsedCpuTime()` measures only MpvRx's own process, not the whole device.
- **Frame drop text now shows per-second deltas** alongside the all-time totals, so you can tell current rendering pressure at a glance.
- **Pause-aware poll backoff**: the stats loop backs off from 1 s to 2 s intervals when playback is paused, cutting pointless JNI calls when metrics are static.

### Gesture & Action Overlay Toggles

- Added a new **"Gesture & Action Overlays"** section in Player Settings with seven independent on/off switches:
  - **Volume slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during volume swipe
  - **Brightness slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during brightness swipe
  - **Hold speed overlay**  speed badge and slider shown during long-press speed boost
  - **Aspect ratio feedback**  pill shown when cycling aspect ratio
  - **Zoom level feedback**  pill shown when pinching to zoom
  - **Repeat & shuffle feedback**  pill shown when toggling repeat or shuffle
  - **Action feedback pills**  brief text pills from custom buttons, ambient toggle, subtitle drag, and Lua/JS scripts
- All overlays default to **on**, so existing behaviour is unchanged until the user opts out.
- Disabling an overlay suppresses only the visual pill  the underlying gesture action (volume change, speed change, etc.) still happens normally.

- Long-pressing the HDR button now opens an HDR Output panel with Off, SDR with HDR, and Normal HDR modes.
- Media title resolution improved: MPV's resolved title is preferred for non-direct-media URLs and when the current filename looks like a generic route (e.g., `/watch`, `/stream`).
- Updated mpv library dependency from `mpv-android-lib-v0.0.1.aar` to `mpvlib.aar` and removed the old AAR.
- Added Multiple new provider to Wyzie subtitle sources.
